# CSS frameworks rapport

\*By Torjus Nilsen, Bendik Bjerkset og Krystian Cruz

In this CA we have been tasked with creating a social media application with a CSS framework of our choosing. We have created three pages a home page, Profile page and login page. To create these three pages, we have used the framework react and NEXT.js. We chose to also work with NEXT.js is that it is great practice to get started already. The CSS framework we have chosen to work with is Tailwind CSS and some typescript. We have all in the group contributed making every page. We have all had our specific tasks for the construction of the pages.

### Why tailwind and next.js

We have chosen tailwind CSS because it allows us to create great and responsive websites quickly. It can provide a set of pre-designed classes thath can be applied directly to HTML elements or imported. This approach is less time consuming and eliminates the need to write custom CSS classes witch results in faster development times. And you can easily customize the styling with additional components. Next.js also has a strong integration with Vercel. Both Next.js and tailwind work very good together. When used in combination, Next.js streamlines server-side-rendering, routing and other tasks, while tailwind simplifies the styling. You can find numerous plugins, extensions, and resources developed by the community to further enhance the development workflow and access solutions to common development challenges

### The pages

On the home page we have an Api of dummy social media users and posts provided within the file structure. The Api of social media posts are styled in a card component within the cards have a profile image of an avatar, we have a username, a brief post title and the main content of the post, you can also see how many likes the post have and description of what the post is about. We have a basic search bar and a button where you can write your own posts. On the profile page you can see some basic information about your user and other users and along with a picture. On the page you also have a short form where you can post on your on wall and other people´s walls. On the sign in page, it is not weary much just a basic in logging form.

## Summary

In summary this CA was a good experience for the whole team too. It was overall a good experience to work as a team and we have done well good on some areas and struggled with others. One of the areas with struggled with is the way to work in groups in GitHub. It took some time to get a good concept of merging and pooling requests and always have the newest code from GitHub on our own local VS code, so we all are updated and don’t mix old and new code. Apart from understanding the concepts merging and pooling form GitHub to work as a team was good, we are all on deferent levels of coding and distributed work we felt comfortable completing, one took more complicated tasks as working with the Api and others took on tasks as just basic styling and working with components in tailwind and the understanding of Next.js. selected.
